Some hacking with graph clusterings and modularity.

Main script will fetch one's facebook direct neighborhood, cluster it and draw a nice png :-)

Requirements:
 * Ruby 
 * the koala gem
 * the graphviz tools
 * a facebook access token - go to graph.facebook.com -> tools -> graph explorer, you'll need to enable the facebook graph app.
